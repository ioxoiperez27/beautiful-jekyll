## Muffins have a rich history that dates back several centuries:

Origins in England: The word “muffin” is believed to have originated in England, derived from the French word “moufflet,” meaning soft. Early muffins were baked on a griddle and were more like flatbreads or quick breads.

19th Century Rise: By the 19th century, muffins evolved into the sweeter, lighter baked goods we know today. The introduction of baking powder around this time revolutionized muffin-making, allowing for a fluffier texture.

American Adaptation: Muffins made their way to America with early settlers. In the U.S., they transformed into what we now recognize as the standard muffin, often sweetened and served as a breakfast item or snack.
